# Contributing to EchoCore Sync

We welcome insights, issue reports, and clean modular pull requests aligned with the following principles:

## Contribution Guidelines
- Keep it lightweight and offline-first
- Maintain compatibility with `vitals.db` as primary backend
- Avoid adding unnecessary cloud services or dependencies
- No third-party analytics, telemetry, or data sync without approval

## Before Submitting
- Run your module locally and test against `agent_bridge_sqlite.py`
- Ensure `core_logger.py` remains the logging interface
- Document your feature in `deployment_notes.md` if merged

All contributions are subject to review and must align with the sovereign, self-hosted design vision of Reiver Corps and DVS.

ðŸ§  Stay tactical.
